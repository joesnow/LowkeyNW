		Sometimes it pays to be picky.
		A hybrid between noise gating and granular processing.

		From the original Hipno documentation: 
		"With controls that should be familiar to most noise gate users, GoMoDo allows you to be more selective with your grain production. 
		Instead of processing everything that comes down the pipeline, the user can specify how loud the incoming sound must be before it will be added to the sampling buffer. 
		Grain production continues even when the buffer is not being updated, the processor just keeps using the last bit of sound that was over the threshold. 
		No more processing that background hiss, just give me the good stuff!" 

		GoMoDo was originally part of the Hipno plug-in package distributed by Cycling'74. 
		While this 2.0 version is not an exact replica of the original, it resurrects many of the key features for use in Ableton Live and Cycling'74 Max.
