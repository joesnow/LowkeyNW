#Jamoma Module Test

##About
This folder contains a basic Jamoma Module that makes use of features found in Jamoma 0.6, including MVC separation. As such, it will not work unless the Jamoma Max implementation is installed. 

The effect itself provides basic granular processing with 2 voices per channel. It was created as an initial test prior to building more complex effects. Going forward, I anticipate that further effects will be distributed within the Jamoma repository.
