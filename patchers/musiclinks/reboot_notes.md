# Musiclinks reboot

## Next steps on 28 March 2017
1. memory / query system so that new tracks get current settings from network
2. better way to display scale struct -- is that a kslider?
3. Right now Live Device overwrites pitch data. Is there a more elegant solution?
4. Master control is sent from Max. Is this OK?
